# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
